Make sure to print something clearly distinguishable between your answers.

For example:

```Python
print("2 *******************************")
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

print("3 *******************************")
for i in range(10,0,-1):
    print(i)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day (also with an extra zero if it's smaller than 10).
1. Create a list containing the names of four countries.
1. Print the list using one `print` statement.
1. Print every item of the list using a `for` loop.
1. Print every item of the list twice using just one `for` loop.
1. Print every item of the list in uppercase using one `for` loop.
1. Print every item of the list using a for loop, but print `This is my list:` before you print the items.
1. Same as before, but also print `This was my list.` after you have printed all items.
1. Same as before, but also print `This is one item of my list:` before every item.
1. Same as before, but also print `This was one item of my list.` after every item.
1. Create a list containing the numbers 1 to 10 (inclusive).
1. Print your list.
1. Using a `for` loop, print your own name ten times.
1. Using a `for` loop, print the following numbers: `2,4,6,8,10` .
1. Using a `for` loop, print the following numbers: `10,8,6,4,2,0` .
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file.
