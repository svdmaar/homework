Homework

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a simple function that just prints the name of city where you live.
1. Call that function.
1. Create a function that accepts two arguments. It should print the sum of those two.
1. Test your function with `3` and `5`.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
