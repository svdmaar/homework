When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 3 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. In a seperate module, create a `StringBuilder` class. It starts out with an empty string member and allows for appending text with an `append` method. To get the final string, it has a `toString` method.
1. Create three unit tests for this class in the main module.
1. Make sure you have a github account.
1. Create a new repository and upload the project you created for these homework questions.

Good luck!
