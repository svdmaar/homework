When answering the following questions, please put a very visisble print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Ask the user for their name. Store their name in a variable.
1. Say something nice to the user, for example: `Hello, Sander, nice to meet you!`
1. Ask the user for some text. Store this one also in a variable.
1. Shout it back to the user 10 times, in all-caps.
1. Ask the user for a letter. Store it in a variable.
1. Print that letter 20 times on one line.
1. Ask the user for a name in all lower case.
1. Print that name with every first letter uppercase, the rest lower case.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
