When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Ask the user for their name. Store their name in a variable.
1. Say something nice to the user, for example: `Hello, Sander, nice to meet you!`
1. Ask the user for some text. Store this one also in a variable.
1. Shout it back to the user 10 times, in all-caps.
1. Ask the user for a name in all lower case.
1. Print that name with every first letter uppercase, the rest lower case.
1. Ask the user for two numbers, tell the user the sum of those two numbers.
1. Ask the user for three numbers, tell the user which one is the biggest.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
