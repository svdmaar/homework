When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a list containing seven English words.
1. Using slicing and a `for` loop, print the last three items, all on separate lines.
1. Add the word `football` to the end of your list.
1. Using `for` and `if`, loop over your list and print `football` in lower-case, print the rest in upper-case followed by an `!`.
1. Using `for` and `if`, loop over your list and print everything except `football`.
1. Using `list` and `range`, create the list `[10, 11, 12, 13, ..., 20]`
1. Using `for` and `if`, print all numbers smaller than 16 on seperate lines.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send us the URL of that file.

Good luck!
