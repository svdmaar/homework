When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a function that modifies a list by adding a new item to it: the number of items in the list. It also returns the list.
1. Call your function in a `for`-loop `10`-times. Start with an empty list. Afterwards, print your list.
1. Create a list with three items.
1. Call your function again, but this time make sure your list is not modified. Still print the output from the function.
1. Create a function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments. It should print the number of arguments it received and should return the arguments as a list.
1. Call you function with 8 arguments. Print the output.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
