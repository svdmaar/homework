Homework

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a variable containing your first name.
1. Print the result of giving it to `len()` as input.
1. Create a variable containing your full name.
1. Print the result of giving it to `len()` as input.
1. What does the `len()` function do for strings?
1. Create a class `StringBuilder`. It should have one member variable that starts as an empty string.
1. Add a member function called `append`. It will have one argument: the string to add to the end of that one member variable.
1. Add a member function `len`. It has no arguments and returns the length of the string in the member variable.
1. Add a member function `getString`. It has no arguments and returns the contents of the one member variable.
1. Add a member function `getTitle`. It has no arguments and returns the contents of the one member variable with every word starting with a capital letter.
1. Create an instance of your class (outside its definition) and test it by building a string that contains your name. 
1. Test it again, but this time make sure to use its `getTitle` member function.
1. Use a new instance to build the name of your city. Make sure to use `append` at least twice.
1. Use your instances to find out the number of characters in your name and your city.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
