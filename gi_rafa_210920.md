When answering the following questions, please put a very visisble print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 3 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create dictionary containing 5 keys. Have as values: a string, a number, a list, a tuple, and a dictionary.
1. Print your dictionary.
1. Using a `for` loop, print all keys.
1. Using a `for` loop, print all values.
1. Using a `for` loop, print all items (key-value-pairs) as tuples.
1. Using a `for` loop, print all items, but this time "unpack" the tuples already in the `for` loop using a comma.
1. Print all keys in alphabetical order.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
