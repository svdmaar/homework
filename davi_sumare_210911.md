When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Using `for` and `range`, print all numbers between `60` and `70` ("inclusive", so also `60` and `70`).
1. Copy/paste your `for` loop and modify it so only numbers smaller than `63` and bigger than `67` are printed.
1. Copy/paste your `for` loop and modify it so only numbers between `62` and `65` are printed.
1. Create the list `[2,4,6,8,10,12]`
1. Using a `for` loop, loop over all numbers in `1,2,3,4,...10` and only print it if it is in the list you created in the previous question.
1. Create new boolean variable that contains `False`.
1. Using a `for` loop, loop over the values `1,2,3,4,...,10`. Set your boolean variable to `True` if any of the numbers is higher than `8`.
1. Using an `if/else` statement, print the correct sentence: either `There was at least one number bigger than 8` or `There were no numbers bigger than 8`.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send us the URL of that file.

Good luck!
