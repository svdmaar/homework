Remember to use # as comments before every answer.

For example:

```Python
# Question 1
print("I love Programming!")

# Question 2
print("I can't wait to make my first game!")
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a list containing the names of five fruits.
1. Print the second item in the list.
1. Add `door bell` to the list (is not a fruit, we know).
1. Print the new list.
1. Replace the first fruit in your list with your name.
1. Print the new list.
1. Make a new variable consisting of the first two items of the list, seperated by a space.
1. Print that one.
1. Make a new variable that contains the last item from the list, but in all uppercase.
1. Print that variable as well.
1. Add the name of your dog to the list, but not in the beginning or end, but make it the third element in the list.
1. Print the list.
1. Remove the second element from your list.
1. Print the list.
1. Remove the last element from the list, but `pop` it. Store the popped item in a new variable.
1. Print the list and the contents of that new variable.
1. Also `pop` the first item of your list and store in a variable.
1. Print the list and the contents of that new variable.
1. Create a list containing the strings `car`, `bike`, `ship`.
1. Print the list.
1. Pop two elements from the list, each time storing the result in the same variable.
1. Print that variable, but before printing, guess what is in there.
1. Print the new list. How many elements has it? Why?
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the .py-file. Send us the URL of your repo.

Good luck!
