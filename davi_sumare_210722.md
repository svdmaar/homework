When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Using a for-loop, print the numbers `1,2,3,...,10`
1. Using a for-loop, print the numbers `2,4,6,...,20`
1. Using `list` and `range`, create this list: `[11, 8, 5, 2, -1]`
1. Using a `for`-loop, create this list: `[4, 5, 6, 7]`
1. Using a `for` loop, create the following list: `[1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22]`. So the difference between the numbers increase by one.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
