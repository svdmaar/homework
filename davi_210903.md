When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a class with two variables stored in it ("fields"). Allow for setting of the values via the `__init__` function.
1. Add a function ("method") to change both of the variables.
1. Create three instances of your class.
1. Use the method to set the member variables of the second instance to zero.
1. Put the three instances in a list.
1. Use a for-loop to print all values stored in all classes.

Good luck!
