When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Using `list` and `range` store this list in a variable: `[4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]` . Hint: see the section in the book about numerical `for` loops.
1. Using a `for` loop, write the items of this list on different lines.
1. Copy-paste your `for` loop, and using an `if` statement, only write the numbers that are smaller than `8` or equal to or greater than `18`.
1. Same as before, but print only the numbers between `10` and `16` (inclusive, so include those numbers as well).
1. Create new boolean variable that contains `True`.
1. Using a `for` loop, loop over your list. Set your boolean variable to `False` if any of the numbers is smaller than `10`.
1. Using an `if/else` statement, print the correct sentence: either `All numbers were 10 or bigger` or `There was at least one number than 10`.
1. Looking back, what would be a good name for your boolean?
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
