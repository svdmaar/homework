Homework

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a function with three arguments. One of the arguments should be default argument with the default value of `8`. The function should calculate the sum of those three values and return it.
1. Call your function with three arguments, store the returned value in a variable.
1. Print the variable
1. Call your function with two arguments, store the returned value in another variable.
1. Print the variable
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
