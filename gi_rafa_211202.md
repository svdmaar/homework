Homework

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a function that accepts a list. It should add one number to the list: the number of items in the list. It should also return this number.
1. Using a `for`-loop, test your function. In every iteration print your list and value returned from the function. Start out with a list of two items.
1. Create a list with four items.
1. Call your function with this list. How many items does it have afterwards?
1. Use slicing to call your function with your list in such a way it won't change your list. Store the returned number in a new variable.
1. Print that new variabe.
1. Create a function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments. It should print the number of arguments it received and should return the arguments as a list.
1. Call your function with 8 arguments. Print the list returned by the function.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
