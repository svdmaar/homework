Homework
-

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Ask the user for some text and store it in a variable.
1. Print that text ten times in all upper case.
1. Ask the user for a number and store it in a variable.
1. Ask the user for another number and store it in another variable.
1. Print the sum of those two numbers
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
