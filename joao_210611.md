Remember to use # as comments before every answer.

For example:

```Python
# Question 1
print("I love Programming!")

# Question 2
print("I can't wait to make my first game!")
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day (also with an extra zero if it's smaller than 10).
1. Create a list containing the names of five foods.
1. Print the second item in the list.
1. `pop` the first item of your list and store in a variable.
1. Print the list and the contents of that new variable.
1. Add another food to your list.
1. Print your new list.
1. Print all items of your list, using a `for` loop.
1. Print all items of your list as upper case, using a `for` loop.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the .py-file. Send us the URL of your repo.

Good luck!
