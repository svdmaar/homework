When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a dictionary with three values: a string, a number, and a list.
1. Print your dictionary.
1. Add one more value to your dictionary.
1. Print it again.
1. Remove one of the values.
1. Print your dictionary once again.
1. Loop over the keys, print each of them on a seperate line.
1. Loop over the values, print each of them on a seperate line.

Good luck!
