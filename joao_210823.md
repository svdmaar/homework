When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a `for` loop that prints the numbers `1,2,3,...,6` on seperate lines.
1. Copy/paste your `for` loop and modify it so it will print this:
```
1 is smaller than 5 and is not bigger than 2
2 is smaller than 5 and is not bigger than 2
3 is smaller than 5 and is bigger than 2
4 is smaller than 5 and is bigger than 2
5 is not smaller than 5 and is bigger than 2
6 is not smaller than 5 and is bigger than 2
```

4. Create a dictionary with two values: a string and a number.
4. Print your dictionary.
4. Add one more value to your dictionary.
4. Print it again.
4. Remove one of the values.
4. Print your dictionary once again.

Good luck!
