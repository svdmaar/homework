Remember to use # as comments before every answer.

For example:

```Python
# Question 1
print("I love Programming!")

# Question 2
print("I can't wait to make my first game!")
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a list containing the names of seven items you might find in a supermarket.
1. Make a new variable consisting of the first two items of the list, seperated by a space.
1. Print that one.
1. Print the second item of the list, but use a negative index.
1. Make a new variable that contains the third item from the list, but in all uppercase.
1. Print that variable as well.
1. Add one more thing to the list, but not in the beginning or end, but make it the fourth element in the list.
1. Print the list.
1. Remove the third element from your list.
1. Print the list.
1. Remove the last element from the list, but `pop` it. Store the popped item in a new variable.
1. Print the list and the contents of that new variable.
1. Also `pop` the first item of your list and store in a variable.
1. Print the list and the contents of that new variable.
1. Sort the list alphabetically.
1. Print the list again.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the .py-file. Send us the URL of this repo.

Good luck!
