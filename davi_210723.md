When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Ask the user for some text.
1. Print the text in upper-case.
1. Ask the user for two strings.
1. Print them together on one line.
1. Ask the user for a number with `input`, store the output string in a variable.
1. Use `int()` to convert the string into a real number and store in the same variable.
1. Add 1 to the number.
1. Print the number.
1. Ask the user for two numbers (on seperate lines). Store both in a list.
1. Calculate the sum of those two numbers.
1. Print the sum.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
