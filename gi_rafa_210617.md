When answering the following questions, please put a very visisble print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 4 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210504`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day (also with an extra 0 if less than 10).
1. Using a `for` loop, create the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
1. Print the list.
1. Using a `for` loop, create the list `[-5, -3, -1, 1, 3, 5]`.
1. Print the list.
1. Using a `for` loop, create the list `[5, 3, 1, -1, -3, -5]`.
1. Print the list.
1. Using a `for` loop, create the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, but use this `for`: `for index in range(10, 0, -1):`.
1. Print the list.
1. Using a `for` loop, create the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, but use this `for`: `for index in range(21, 1, -2):`.
1. Print the list.
1. Using a `for` loop, create the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, but use this `for`: `for index in range(11, -9, -2):`.
1. Print the list.
1. Using a `for` loop, create the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, but use this `for`: `for index in range(50, -14, -7):`.
1. Print the list.
1. Using a `for` loop, create the list `[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144]` (so every entry is the sum of the two before it. Hint: if you want you can put up to three elements in the list before your `for` loop.
1. Print the list.
1. Using a `for` loop, calculate `1+2+3+4+5+...+30`. Print the result.
1. Using a `for` loop, calculate 1 times 2 times 3 times 4 times 5 times 6 times 7 times 8 times 9 times 10.
1. Using a `for` loop, calculate the cubes of `1,2,3,4,...,10` and put them in a list . Hint: the cube of a number is that number multiplied by itself two more times. Example: the cube of 2 is 8 (2 times 2 times 2), the cube of 10 is 1000 (10 times 10 times 10).
1. Print the list.
1. Using two `for` loops, where one is inside the other, create this list: `[10, 11, 20, 21, 30, 31, 40, 41, 50, 51, 60, 61]`.
1. Print the list.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send us the URL of that file.

Good luck!
