When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Ask the user for a number and store it in a variable.
1. Ask the user for another number and store it in another variable.
1. Print the sum of those two numbers.
1. Print all even numbers between 10 and 30, using the `%` operator.
1. Ask the user for some text.
1. Print the text ten times in all upper-case.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send us the URL of that file.

Good luck!
