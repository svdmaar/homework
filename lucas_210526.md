Remember to use # as comments before every answer.

For example:

```Python
# Question 1
print("I love Programming!")

# Question 2
print("I can't wait to make my first game!")
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a list containing the names of six car brands.
1. Print the second item in the list.
1. Add `bicycle` to the list (is not a car, we know).

1. Replace the first brand in your list with your name.
