Homework

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Ask the user for numbers, store those in a list. Continue until the user enters a negative number.
1. Afterwards print the number of entered numbers, their sum, the maximal value, and the minimum.
1. Print the value if you multiply with each other.
1. Bonus: If you know what it means to calculate the average of numbers, also print the average of the entered numbers. Hint: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9dia
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
