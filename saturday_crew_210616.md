When answering the following questions, please put a very visisble print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a list of three items. You can put there what ever you want.
1. Print the list using one `print` statement.
1. Print every item of the list using a `for` loop.
1. Print every item of the list twice using just one `for` loop.
1. Print every item of the list in uppercase using one `for` loop.
1. Print every item of the list using a for loop, but print `This is my list:` before you print the items.
1. Same as before, but also print `This was my list.` after you have printed all items.
1. Same as before, but also print `This is one item of my list:` before every item.
1. Same as before, but also print `This was one item of my list.` after every item.
1. Print the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 23 on seperate lines using a `for` loop.
1. Create a list containing the numbers [11, 14, 17, 20, 23] using `range` but without a `for` loop.
1. Print that list.
1. Create a list containing the numbers [1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16] using a `for` loop. Hint: feel free to create another number variable.

1. Print the list.
1. Using slicing, print the first three items.
1. Using slicing, print the last three items.
1. Using slicing, print the second, third, and fourth item.
1. Using slicing, print the first, third, and fifth item.
1. Using slicing, print the same, but in reverse order.
