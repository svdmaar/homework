When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 3 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Use `google.com` to figure out how to get the current date.
1. Create a function that write the current date to a file. It will have one argument: the output path.
1. Test the function by writing the current date to `today.txt`.
1. Create a function that reads the first line from a file and returns it.
1. Test it on the file you just wrote. Print the read string.
1. Use this function also to read the file `hoje.txt`. This will throw an exception. Catch the exception outside your function.

Good luck!
