1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a variable that contains your name.
1. Create a variable to contains your age.
1. Print the contents of those two variables together on one line.
1. Do the same, but this time with an `!` after it.
1. Do the same as last question, but also put a space between your name and your age. So it should print something like this: `Sander 39!`. You need to use the two earlier created variables.
1. Create a variable containing your first name and last time separated by a space.
1. Print the variable.
1. Print the variable, but all in uppercase.
1. Print the variable, but all in lowercase.
1. Print the variable, but have only your first name and last name start with a capital letter. The rest needs to be small.
1. Using only one print statement, write your first name on one line, and your last name on a second.
1. Same as before, but put a tab before your last name.
1. Write `\novo` to the screen.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py` file.

Good luck!
