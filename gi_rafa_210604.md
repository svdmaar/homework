Remember to use # as comments before every answer.

For example:

```Python
# Question 1
print("I love Programming!")

# Question 2
print("I can't wait to make my first game!")
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a list containing the names of five fruits.
1. Print the second item in the list.
1. Find a way to make the list alphabetically sorted.
1. Print the list again.
1. Add the fruit `apple` to the end of your list.
1. Print the list again.
1. Add `zucchini` to the beginning of the list.
1. Print the list again.
1. Create a sorted copy of your list.
1. Print both your original list as the sorted version of it.
1. Add another fruit to the original (unsorted list). Will this change the sorted copy?
1. Print both lists again to check your answer.

Loops
--

When answering the following questions, please put a very visisble print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 15 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

14. Create a list of three items. You can put there what ever you want.
1. Print the list using one `print` statement.
1. Print every item of the list using a `for` loop.
1. Print every item of the list twice using just one `for` loop.
1. Print every item of the list in uppercase using one `for` loop.
1. Print every item of the list using a for loop, but print `This is my list:` before you print the items.
1. Same as before, but also print `This was my list.` after you have printed all items.
1. Same as before, but also print `This is one item of my list:` before every item.
1. Same as before, but also print `This was one item of my list.` after every item.

1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file.

Good luck!
