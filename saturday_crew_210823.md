for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Write a text file to disk.
1. Open the text file. Count the number of words. Print this number.
1. Create a dictionary that has four key-value-pairs. The values should be a number, a string, a list, and a dictionary.
1. Print your dictionary.
1. Store your dictionary in a json file.
1. Read your dictionary back from the json file.
1. Create a function that returns the sum of its two arguments.
1. Create two unit tests that tests your function.

Good luck!
