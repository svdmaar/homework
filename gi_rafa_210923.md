When answering the following questions, please put a very visisble print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 3 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Using a `for`-loop and `range`, print the following numbers on seperate lines: `1, 2, 3, ..., 20`
1. Copy/paste that `for`-loop, and don't change the arguments to `range`. Change your `for`-loop so it only prints all even numbers.
1. Using a `while`-loop calculate: `1+2+3+4+5+...+500`.
1. Print the result.
1. Using a `while`-loop calculate: `1*2*3*4*..*10`.
1. Print the result.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
