When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a game where the user needs to answer mathematical questions. For example: `What is 14 plus 32?`. Print if the user is right or not.
1. Keep track of the number of right answers the user gave.
1. Use a `while` loop to print your name 6 times.
1. Use `%` to print all odd numbers between 0 and 50. Hint: odd numbers are numbers that are not even. So they are not evenly divisible by 2.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
