When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Using a `while`-loop and `%`, print all even numbers between 40 and 60.
1. Using a `while`-loop, ask the user for input and shout it back to him/her in all-caps followed by three exclamation marks. When the user enters `done` or `DONE`, exit the application.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
