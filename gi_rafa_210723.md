When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a list containing five English words.
1. Print the list.
1. Using slicing and a `for` loop, print the first, third, and fifth item, all on separate lines.
1. Create a "real" copy of your list using slicing. So that when you change your copy, it won't change the original list.
1. Add one more word to your list.
1. Print the copy of your list to show that it didn't change.
1. Create a tuple containing `(10, 200, 300)` .
1. Using a `for` loop, print the numbers stored in your tuple on seperate lines.
1. Using a `for` loop and `range`, print the numbers `1,2,3,4,5,...,20`
1. Copy/paste your `for` loop and use `if` to print all numbers smaller than 5. 
1. Copy/paste your `for` loop and use `if` to print all numbers bigger than or equal to 14.
1. Copy/paste your `for` loop and use `if` to print all numbers smaller than 6 or bigger than 18.
1. Copy your answer from the last question, but use an `else` to apologize for not printing the other numbers. 
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
