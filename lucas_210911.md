When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a new module called `mult.py`.
1. Create a function in that module that returns the product of an arbitrary number of arguments.
1. Import this function from your main module in all different ways explained in the book and call your function each time, printing the result. Everytime make sure to comment out the earlier `import`.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
