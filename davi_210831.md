When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a class with three variables stored in it ("fields").
1. Add a function ("method") to change one of the variables.
1. Create two instances of your class.
1. Change all variables of the first one.
1. Change only one of the second, using the method you created in `3`.

Good luck!
