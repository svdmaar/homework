When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Ask the user for their first name in all lower-case. Store it in a variable.
1. Ask the user for their last name in all lower-case. Store it in a variable.
1. Print their first and last name seperated by a space. Make sure their names start with an upper-case letter, but the rest should be lower-case.
1. Ask for three first and last names and do the same. You might need a `for`-loop. Store the names in a list of dictionaries with the keys `first name` and `last name`.
1. Print your list of dictionaries.
1. Loop over your list and print the first and last names in the same style as question 4.
1. Ask the user for two numbers.
1. Print the difference of the two numbers.
1. Using a `while`-loop, print your name 5 times.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
