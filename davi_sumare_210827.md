When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Using a `for`-loop, print the number `30,31,32,33,...,40`.
1. Copy/paste your `for`-loop and use an `if` to print all numbers except `35`.
1. Copy/paste your `for`-loop and use an `if` to print all numbers smaller than `35`.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send us the URL of that file.

Good luck!
