1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day (also with an extra 0 if less than 10).
1. Create a variable that contains your name.
1. Create a variable that contains the name of your city.
1. Print the contents of those two variables together on one line.
1. Do the same, but this time with an `!` after it.

1. Create a variable containing your first name and last time separated by a space.
1. Print the variable.
1. Print the variable, but all in uppercase.
1. Print the variable, but all in lowercase.

1. Same as before, but put a tab before your last name.
1. Create a variable containing the name of your favorite food, but have two spaces on each side.
1. Print the variable. It should show something like: `  Pasta  `.
1. Now print the variable again, but let it be followed by an exclamation mark. So output should be something like this: `  Pasta  !`.
1. Write `\novo` to the screen.

Good luck!
