Remember to use # as comments before every answer.

For example:

```Python
# Question 1
print("I love Programming!")

# Question 2
print("I can't wait to make my first game!")
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day (also with an extra zero if it's smaller than 10).
1. Using `for` and `range`, print the following numbers on separate lines: `7,5,3,1,-1,-3,-5,-7`.
1. Using `for`, create a list that contains your name `10` times
1. Create a list containing the names of five cities.
1. Using slicing, print the first three items.
1. Using slicing, print the last three items.
1. Using slicing, print the second, third, and fourth item.
1. Using slicing, print the first, third, and fifth item.
