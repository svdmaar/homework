Homework
-

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. `from time import time`. This will give you a function called `time()` that will return the number of seconds since January 1st 1970. See for more information: https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.time .
1. Create a function `wait` that has one argument: the number of seconds to wait. For example: if you call it with `5`, it will wait for five seconds before returning.
1. Test your function with `1`, `2`, `5`, `10` seconds.
1. `from time import sleep`
1. Run `sleep(1)` and `sleep(3)`, what does `sleep` do?
1. Can you improve your `wait` function using `sleep`?
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
