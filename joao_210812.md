When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Using a `for` loop, write the numbers `11,12,13,...,20` on seperate lines.
1. Copy-paste your `for` loop, and using an `if` statement, only write the numbers that are bigger than `17`.
1. Same as before, but print only the numbers smaller than or equal to `12`.
1. Same as before, but print only the numbers smaller than or equal to `14`, or larger than `18`.
1. Same as before, but print only the numbers between `12` and `15` (inclusive).
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send us the URL of that file.

Good luck!
