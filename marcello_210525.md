Remember to use # as comments before every answer.

For example:

```Python
# Question 1
print("I love Programming!")

# Question 2
print("I can't wait to make my first game!")
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a variable that contains your name.
1. Create a variable to contains your age.
1. Print the contents of those two variables together on one line.
1. Using only one print statement, write your first name on one line, and your last name on a second.
1. Same as before, but put a tab before your last name.
1. Create a variable containing the name of your favorite video game character, but have three spaces on each side.
1. Print the variable. It should show something like: `   Mario   `.
1. Now print the variable again, but let it be followed by an exclamation mark. So output should be something like this: `   Mario   !`.
1. Copy/paste the last line and find a way to remove all spaces. So the output should be something like: `Mario!`.
1. Same as before, but remove only spaces on the left side. So something like this: `Mario   !`.
1. Create a list containing the names of three fruits.
1. Print the list.
1. Print the second item in the list.
1. Create a new public repo on github with the same name as your project and upload everything except for the `.vs` folder. Send us the URL of your repo.

Good luck!
