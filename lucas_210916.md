Homework

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a simple class: it has only one member function: `__init__`. In this member function you just print your own name.
1. Outside the class definition, create an instance of your class.
1. Outside the class definition, add a member variable to the instance of your class.
1. Print the value of that member variable.
1. Copy/paste your class, rename it, and add another member function. This function should add an extra member variable and set it to the value `12`.
1. Outside this second class definition, create an instance of this second class.
1. Call the member function you added.
1. Print the value of the member variable that was added by that member function.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
