1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Write `\novo` to the screen.
1. Create a variable that has the name of your dog in it, but with three spaces on the left and on the right. So for example something like: `   Piasta   `
1. Print this variable.
1. Why is the name of your dog a little to the right?
1. Can you see the spaces on the right. Why or why not?
1. Print the variable again, but this time followed with an exclamation mark. Why are there spaces between the name of your dog and the exclamation mark?
1. Print the variable again, followed by an exclamation mark, but is such a way it is all the way to the left and that there are no spaces between the name of your dog and the exclamation mark.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the .py-file. Send us the URL of your repo.

Good luck!
