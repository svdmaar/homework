Make sure to print something clearly distinguishable between your answers.

For example:

```Python
print("2 *******************************")
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

print("3 *******************************")
for i in range(10,0,-1):
    print(i)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day (also with an extra zero if it's smaller than 10).
1. Using a `for` loop, create a list containing the numbers 1 to 10 (inclusive).
1. Print your list.
1. Create the same list again, but without using a `for` loop.
1. Print your list.
1. Using a `for` loop, print your own name ten times.
1. Using a `for` loop, print your own name ten times, but now also use that same loop to create a list containing your name 10 times.
1. Print the list.
1. Using two `for` loops, create a list that contains your name five times in lower-case and then five times in upper-case.
1. Print the list.
1. Using a `for` loop, create a list that contains your name in lower case ten times.
1. Using a second `for` loop, change the last five items of that list to your name in upper-case.
1. Print the list.
1. Using a `for` loop, create the following list: `[1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22]`. Hint: feel free to use an extra variable outside (before) your `for` loop.
1. Print the list.

1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file.

Good luck!
