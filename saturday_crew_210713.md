When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 3 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create dictionary containing 3 keys. Have as values: a string, a number, and a list.
1. Loop over all values in the dictionary.
1. Add a new key/value pair to your dictionary, with the value being a dictionary.
1. Ask the user for five numbers and output the smallest of them.
1. Ask the user for the names and ages of five people. Store this data in a list of dictionaries. In a new `for` loop, print all information and whether their ages are even numbers.
1. Create a list containing `apple`, `banana`, `orange`, `apple`, and `apple` . Remove all instances of `apple`, but use the function `.remove()` only once in your program.
1. Print the list to check if indeed there are no more `apple`s.
1. Create a list with six countries.
1. Print the list in reversed order.
1. Using a `for` loop, print the numbers `1,2,3,4,...,10`, but after each number ask if the user wants to continue. If not, stop the loop.

Good luck!
