Make sure to print something clearly distinguishable between your answers.

For example:

```Python
print("2 *******************************")
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

print("3 *******************************")
for i in range(10,0,-1):
    print(i)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day (also with an extra zero if it's smaller than 10).
1. Create a list containing the names of five fruits.
1. Print the second item in the list.
1. Find a way to make the list alphabetically sorted.
1. Print the list again.
1. Add the fruit `apple` to the end of your list.
1. Print the list again.
1. Add `zucchini` to the beginning of the list.
1. Print the list again.
1. Create a sorted copy of your list.
1. Print both your original list as the sorted version of it.
1. Add another fruit to the original (unsorted list). Will this change the sorted copy?
1. Print both lists again to check your answer.
1. Using a `for` loop, print all items in your list.
1. Using a `for` loop, print all items in your list, but this time in uppercase.
1. Using a `for` loop, print all items in your list, this time lowercase and uppercase together on one line, but separated by a space.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file.

Good luck!
