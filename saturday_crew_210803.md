When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 3 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a function that accepts a list of numbers. It should add a new element to the list: the sum of the numbers in the list. It will also return this newly added value.
1. Call the function ten times in a for-loop. Start with the list `[1, 2, 3]`.
1. Call the function once more, but this time in such a way it won't change the list.
1. Create a function that accepts a variable number of arguments and it returns a list containing those arguments.
1. Test your function with four arguments and print the returned list.
1. Copy/paste your function, but modify in such a way that it will only work when it receives at least two arguments.
1. Test your function again with the same arguments as before and print the returned list.
1. Create a function that accepts arbitrary keyword arguments and prints the keywords and the respective values on different lines.
1. Create a new module called `adding.py`.
1. Create a function in that module that returns the sum of two numbers passed to it via arguments.
1. Call your function from your main module and print the result.

Good luck!
