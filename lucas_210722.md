When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Ask the user for two numbers, store them in a list.
1. Print the sum of the two numbers.
1. Ask the user for this information of three people: name and age. Store the information in three dictionaries in a list.
1. Loop over the list and print the information.
1. Create this program to help calculating the user's age:

Sample 1 (bold-faced is user input, rest is printed by your application):
<pre>
What is your name? <b>Sander</b>
What year were you born? <b>1982</b>
Did you have your birthday already? <b>yes</b>
Hi Sander! you are 39 years old.
</pre>

Sample 2:
<pre>
What is your name? <b>Fernanda</b>
What year were you born? <b>1986</b>
Did you have your birthday already? <b>no</b>
Hi Fernanda! you are 34 years old.
</pre>

So the program would ask for the user's name, year of birth, and whether he/she had her birthday already.

7. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
