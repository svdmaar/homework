Remember to use # as comments before every answer.

For example:

```Python
# Question 1
print("I love Programming!")

# Question 2
print("I can't wait to make my first game!")
```

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is June 1st 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210601`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day (also with an extra 0 if less than 10).
