for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a dictionary with three key/value-pairs. The values should be: a string, a number, and a list. Put the key/value-pairs on different lines.
1. Print the dictionary.
1. Using the right key, print the string-value.
1. Modify the number-value in the dictionary.

1. Remove the key/value-pair your just added.
