Homework

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Commit and push your game as it is now to the github repository.
1. Read about events: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evento_(computa%C3%A7%C3%A3o) . There is also an English explanation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(computing) .
1. Maybe also read about Event Loops: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%C3%A7o_de_eventos .
1. Make sure the spaceship keeps moving when the user holds the right key down. When the user lets go of the key, stop the spaceship.
1. Do the same with the left key, but this time have the spaceship moving left.
1. Commit and push your work to the github repository.


Good luck!
