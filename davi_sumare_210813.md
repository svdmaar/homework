When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a list containing seven English words.
1. Print the list.
1. Using slicing, print the first four items.
1. Using slicing, print the last four items.
1. Using slicing, print the third, fourth, and fifth item.
1. Using slicing, print the second, fourth, and sixth item.
1. Using slicing, print the same, but in reverse order.
1. Using slicing and a `for` loop, print the last three items, all on separate lines.
1. Add the word `football` to the end of your list.
1. Using `for` and `if`, loop over your list and print `football` in lower-case, print the rest in upper-case followed by an `!`.
1. Using `for` and `if`, loop over your list and print everything except `football`.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send us the URL of that file.

Good luck!
