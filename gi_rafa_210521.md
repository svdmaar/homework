Remember to use # as comments before every answer.

For example:

```Python
# Question 1
print("I love Programming!")

# Question 2
print("str() and int() is really easy!")
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project. Think of a funny name.
1. Create a variable that contains your first name, all lower-case.
1. Create a variable that contains your last name, all lower-case.
1. Create a new variable that consists of those two combined, with a space between them.
1. Print this one.
1. Using this last variable, print your first and last name starting with a capital letter, but the rest should be lower-case.
1. The same, but print everything upper-case.
1. Just using one simple print statement (so don't use variables), print your first and last name on different lines.
1. Use python to find out what is 100 minus 23.
1. Use python to find out what is 97 plus 12.
1. Use python to find out what is 14 times 9.
1. Use python to find out what is 112 divided by 18.
1. Sorry about this, but let's once more repeat this: which of these lines is valid Python? What do they print? And the other ones: why don't they work?
```Python
# a
print(1+1)
# b
print("1"+"1")
# c
print(1+"1")
# d
print("1"+1)
# e
print(str(1)+"1")
# f
print(1+str("1"))
# g
print(int(1)+"1")
# h
print(1+int("1"))
# i
print(int(1)+str("1"))
# j
print(str(1)+int("1"))
```

Create a new repository in github and upload your .py file. Send us the link to it, so we can have a look at it.

Next week we will be starting chapter 3!
