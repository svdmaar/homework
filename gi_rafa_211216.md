When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 3 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a function that accepts arbitrary keyword arguments and prints the keywords and the respective values on different lines.
1. Test your function with three keyword arguments.
1. Create a new module called `adding.py`.
1. Create a function in that module that returns the sum of two numbers passed to it via arguments.
1. Call your function from your main module and print the result.

Good luck!
