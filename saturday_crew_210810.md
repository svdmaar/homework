When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 3 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a class called `Adder` that has one member `value` (initialized to 0), and the following members: `add` (adds a number to `value`), `get_value` (returns the value of `value`), and `reset` (which sets the value to 0).
1. Create a class called `Calculator`, which is derived from `Adder`. Besides the methods from `Adder`, it also has `multiply`, which multiplies `value` with a number.
1. Create an instance of the class `Calculator` and use all the methods.
1. Move `Adder` and `Calculator` to their own modules.
1. Make sure your code from question 4 still works.

Good luck!
