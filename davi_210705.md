When answering the following questions, please put a very visisble print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a list containing seven countries.
1. Print the list.
1. Using slicing, print the first four items.
1. Using slicing, print the last three items.
1. Using slicing, print the second, third, and fourth item.
1. Using slicing, print the third, fifth, and seventh item.
1. Using slicing, print the same, but in reverse order.
1. Using slicing and a `for` loop, print the first, third, fifth, and seventh item, all on separate lines.
1. Create a list containing the strings `apple`, `Apple`, `APPLE`, and `banana`.
1. Loop over your list with a `for` loop and print every item.
1. Loop over your list with a `for` loop and use an `if` statement to print just `apple`.
1. Loop over your list with a `for` loop and use an `if` statement to print just `apple`, but compare ignoring case.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
