When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create an empty list.
1. Using an `if/else`-statement and the simplest possible condition using this list, print the right sentence: `The list is empty`, `The list is not empty`.
1. Create a new list containing two numbers and one string.

1. Using the correct key, print the number value.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send us the URL of that file.

Good luck!
