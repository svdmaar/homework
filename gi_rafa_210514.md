Remember to use # as comments before every answer.

For example:

```Python
# Question 1
print("I love Programming!")

# Question 2
print("I can't wait to make my first game!")
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a variable that contains your name.
1. Create a variable to contains your age.
1. Print the contents of those two variables together on one line.
1. Do the same, but this time with an `!` after it.
1. Do the same as last question, but also put a space between your name and your age. So it should print something like this: `Sander 39!`. You need to use the two earlier created variables.
1. Create a variable containing your first name and last time separated by a space.
1. Print the variable.
1. Print the variable, but all in uppercase.
1. Print the variable, but all in lowercase.
1. Print the variable, but have only your first name and last name start with a capital letter. The rest needs to be small.
1. Using only one print statement, write your first name on one line, and your last name on a second.
1. Same as before, but put a tab before your last name.
1. Create a variable containing the name of your favorite food, but have two spaces on each side.
1. Print the variable. It should show something like: `  Pasta  `.
1. Now print the variable again, but let it be followed by an exclamation mark. So output should be something like this: `  Pasta  !`.
1. Copy/paste the last line and find a way to remove all spaces. So the output should be something like: `Pasta!`.
1. Calculate and print how much is 102 divided by 23.
1. Ask the user to enter his/her favorite food. Shout it back at him/her in all caps three times on the same line! So if I would type `pasta`, it will shout at me `PASTA PASTA PASTA!`.
1. Of the following lines of python, which ones are valid and if so, what do they print?
```Python
# a
print(1+1)
# b
print("1"+"1")
# c
print(1+"1")
# d
print("1"+1)
# e
print(str(1)+"1")
# f
print(1+str("1"))
# g
print(int(1)+"1")
# h
print(1+int("1"))
# i
print(int(1)+str("1"))
# j
print(str(1)+int("1"))
```

Send us the resulting `.py` file containing all of your answers.

Bonus assignment
---

See how far you can get. This is going to be the first useful program you will create. If you can create it, epic! If not, no problem, we will look at it together during our next class.

Sample 1 (bold-faced is user input, rest is printed by your application):
<pre>
What is your name? <b>Sander</b>
What year were you born? <b>1982</b>
Did you have your birthday already (1: yes, 0: no)? <b>1</b>
Hi Sander! you are 39 years old.
</pre>

Sample 2:
<pre>
What is your name? <b>Fernanda</b>
What year were you born? <b>1986</b>
Did you have your birthday already (1: yes, 0: no)? <b>0</b>
Hi Fernanda! you are 34 years old.
</pre>

So the program would ask for the user's name, year of birth, and whether he/she had her birthday already. This last question is answered with 1 if yes, and with 0 if no.

Some hints:
- Today the year is 2021. Shocking, I know.
- Create your application first without the question whether or not he/she had her birthday and assume everyone has their birthday on January 1st.
- Create a new project for this. Name it something like `age_calculator`.

Good luck!
