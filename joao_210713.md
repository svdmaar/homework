When answering the following questions, please put a very visisble print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a list containing the strings `apple`, `Apple`, `APPLE`, `banana`, `CHERRY`, `orange`, `TOMATO`.
1. Loop over your list with a `for` loop and print every item.
1. Loop over your list with a `for` loop and use an `if` statement to print just `apple`.
1. Loop over your list with a `for` loop and use an `if` statement to print `apple`, `Apple`, and `APPLE`.
1. Do the same, but use `.title()` inside your `for` loop.
1. Loop over your list with a `for` loop and use an `if` statement to print all upper-case fruits (`APPLE`, `CHERRY`, `TOMATO`).
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
