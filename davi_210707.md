When answering the following questions, please put a very visisble print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Using `list` and `range` create this list: `[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]`
1. Print the list.
1. Using slicing, print `[12, 13, 14, 15]`
1. Using slicing, print `[11, 13, 15, 17]`
1. Using slicing, print `[17, 16, 15, 14]`
1. Using slicing, print `[16, 13, 10]`
1. Create a list containing the strings `kiwi`, `ORANGE`, `mango`, and `CHERRY`.
1. Loop over your list with a `for` loop and use an `if` statement to print all fruits that are in upper-case.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
