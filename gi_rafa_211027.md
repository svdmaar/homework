Homework

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Using `for` and `range`, print the numbers `1,2,3,4,...,10` on separate lines.
1. Copy/paste your `for` loop. Without changing the arguments to range, and by using `if` and `continue`, write just the numbers `3,4,5,6` on seperate lines.
1. Create a simple function that just prints your favorite food.
1. Call that function.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
