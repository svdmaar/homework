When answering the following questions, please put a very visisble print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Using a `for` loop, write the numbers `1,2,3,...,20` on seperate lines.
1. Copy/paste that `for` loop, and add one `if` statement, several `elif` statements, and finally one `else`, to write the following:

```
1 is smaller than 4
2 is smaller than 4
3 is smaller than 4
4 is bigger than or equal to 4, but smaller than 8
5 is bigger than or equal to 4, but smaller than 8
6 is bigger than or equal to 4, but smaller than 8
7 is bigger than or equal to 4, but smaller than 8
8 is bigger than or equal to 8, but smaller than 12
9 is bigger than or equal to 8, but smaller than 12
10 is bigger than or equal to 8, but smaller than 12
11 is bigger than or equal to 8, but smaller than 12
12 is bigger than or equal to 12, but smaller than 16
13 is bigger than or equal to 12, but smaller than 16
14 is bigger than or equal to 12, but smaller than 16
15 is bigger than or equal to 12, but smaller than 16
16 is bigger than or equal to 16
17 is bigger than or equal to 16
18 is bigger than or equal to 16
19 is bigger than or equal to 16
20 is bigger than or equal to 16
```

4. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
