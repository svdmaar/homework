for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Using `for` and `range`, print all numbers between `30` and `40` ("inclusive", so also `30` and `40`).
1. Copy/paste your `for` loop and modify it so only numbers smaller than `35` are printed.
1. Copy/paste your `for` loop and modify it so only numbers smaller than  or equal to `35` are printed.
