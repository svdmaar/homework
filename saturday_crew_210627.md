When answering the following questions, please put a very visisble print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 3 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Using `if`, `elif`, and `else`, print whether a variable is smaller than 10, between 10 and 20, between 20 and 30, between 30 and 40, or bigger than 40.
1. Create dictionary containing 3 keys. Have as values: a string, a number, and a list.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
