Homework

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a class with just one member function. This member function should do nothing more than print the name of your city.
1. Outside the class definition, create an instance of your class.
1. After creating it (on a new line), add two member variables to the instance of you class. Both should contain numbers.
1. Print the numbers.
1. Go back to your class definition and add a member function that print those two member variables.
1. Go back to the end of your program and call that new member function.
1. Go back to your class definition and create a member function that returns the product of the two member variables.
1. Go back to the end of your program and print the result of calling that member function.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
