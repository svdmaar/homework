When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a function that accepts three arguments. It should combine those in a list and print that list.
1. Call the function using positional arguments.
1. Call it using keyword arguments.
1. Copy/paste your function and change one argument to a default argument.
1. Call your function using two arguments.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
