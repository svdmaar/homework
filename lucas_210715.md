When answering the following questions, please put a very visisble print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create dictionary containing 6 keys. Have as values: a string, a number, a list, a dictionary, a boolean, and a tuple. Three of the keys should be strings, the other three should be numbers. Write every key/value-pair on another line.
1. Print your dictionary.
1. Using a `for`-loop, print all keys of your dictionary on one line. Hint: you might have to use the `+` symbol.
1. Look one value up in your dictionary using a key and print it.
1. Loop over all key/value-pairs using a `for` loop and print them in seperate lines. Make sure to use a comma in the `for`-loop so you don't have to unpack them yourself.
1. Print the keys in your dictionary in reverse-alphabetical order.
1. Using a `for`-loop, create a dictionary with 10 lists as values, make sure every list is different.
1. Using a `for`-loop, print all 10 lists from your dictionary.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
