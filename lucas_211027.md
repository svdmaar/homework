Homework

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Write the numbers `20, 21, 22, ..., 30` to a new file. They should all be on different lines.
1. Open your file again, this time to append to it.
1. Write the numbers `40, 41, 42, ..., 50` to this file, but all on different lines.
1. In a `while`-loop, ask the user for numbers. Once the user enters an invalid number, don't crash the program, just tell the user that he/she didn't enter a valid number.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
