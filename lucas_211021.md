Homework
-

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Open a file for writing.
1. Write the numbers `1` to `100` on different lines.
1. Open that file for reading.
1. Read all numbers from the file and add them all up.
1. Print the sum of the numbers.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
