When answering the following questions, please put a very visisble print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 2 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Using a `for` loop, write the numbers `1,2,3,...,10` on seperate lines.
1. Copy-paste your `for` loop, and using an `if` statement, only write the numbers that are bigger than `5`.
1. Same as before, but print only the numbers smaller than or equal to `3`.
1. Same as before, but print only the numbers smaller than or equal to `4`, or larger than `8`.
1. Same as before, but print only the numbers between `3` and `6` (inclusive).
1. Create the list `[2,4,6,8,10,12]`
1. Using a `for` loop, loop over all numbers in `1,2,3,4,...10` and only print it if it is in the list you created in the previous question.
1. Create new boolean variable that contains `False`.
1. Using a `for` loop, loop over the values `1,2,3,4,...,10`. Set your boolean variable to `True` if any of the numbers is higher than `8`.
1. Using an `if/else` statement, print the correct sentence: either `There was at least one number bigger than 8` or `There were no numbers bigger than 8`.
1. Create a new repo on github and upload the `.py`-file. Send me the URL of that file.

Good luck!
