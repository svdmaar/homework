When answering the following questions, please put a very visible print statement before your answer. This will help us to match your answer with the correct question. For example:

```Python
print("Question 3 ************************")
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a function that has two arguments.
1. Call it using positional arguments.
1. Call it using keyword arguments.
1. Create a function that accepts two arguments and returns the two arguments as a string, joined with a space.
1. Call the function and print the returned value.
1. Create a function that has two arguments, one of which has a default value.
1. Call it using two arguments and using only one argument, so the default value is used.
1. Create a function that returns the sum of a list of numbers.
1. Use it to calculate the sum of this list: `[21, 32, 54, 43]`

Good luck!
