Remember to use # as comments before every answer.

For example:

```Python
# Question 1
print("I love Programming!")

# Question 2
print("I can't wait to make my first game!")
```

Here are the questions for this week:

1. Create a new project with the following name "name_date". For example: if your name is "Sander" and today is May 14 2021, the name of the project would be: `sander_210514`. So only use the last two digits of today's year and first put the month (with an extra 0 if less than 10) and then today's day.
1. Create a variable containing the name of your favorite sports team.
1. Print the variable.
1. Print the variable three times on one line, with spaces in between.
1. Create a variable that contains the name of one of your brothers.
1. Create a variable that contains his age.
1. Print the contents of those two variables together on one line.
1. Do the same, but this time with an `!` after it.
1. Do the same as last question, but also put a space between his name and his age. So it should print something like this: `Sander 39!`. You need to use the two earlier created variables.
1. What is `1+2*3`?
1. What is `(1+2)*3`?
1. Why are the last two values different?
1. Using only one print statement, write your first name on one line, and your last name on a second.
1. Same as before, but put a tab before your first name.
1. Create a variable containing the name of your favorite food, but have two spaces on each side.
1. Print the variable. It should show something like: `  Pasta  `.
1. Now print the variable again, but let it be followed by an exclamation mark. So output should be something like this: `  Pasta  !`.
1. Copy/paste the last line and find a way to remove all spaces. So the output should be something like: `Pasta!`.
1. Write `\tem` to the screen.
1. Calculate and print how much is 164 divided by 34.
1. Calculate and print how much is 18 multiplied by 12.
1. Create a variable with your first name.
1. Create a variable with your last name.
1. Using the last two variables, create a variable containing your first name and last name separated by a space.
1. Print the variable.
1. Print the variable, but all in uppercase.
1. Print the variable, but all in lowercase.
1. Print the variable, but have only your first name and last name start with a capital letter. The rest needs to be small.
1. Create a new public repo on github with the same name as your project and upload everything except for the `.vs` folder. Send us the URL of your repo.


Good luck!
